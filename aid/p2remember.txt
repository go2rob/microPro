Traces (remembered)
******
Mocha unable to read ES6
  installed babel(register, loader, env setup(.babelrc))
    babel asked to install webpack "yourself"(guessing its or later)
      installed webpack

When trying to load supporting libraries in reliable way(like in JS files, not as script in HTML)
  encountered the existence of "requirejs"
    2 days worked on to learn & finally configured in a common file(requirejs.config)
    -supported great for browser but for test files
        no Idea what to do, dropped there...   <<<(https://github.com/go2rob/microPro/commit/b25c5ed9fdf1c32c3b1a96c6b7e5003046ab290d)>>>
  alternatives for requirejs... had come to know about "webpack is best doing the same" which I have already have
        configuration not understandable.. skipping for now

When loaded on browser 
    (a) Unexpected token import
            solved by changing type attribute of script tag from "text.javascript" to "module"
    (b) Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per 
        -HTML spec.
            referred from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46138375/trouble-with-es6-modules to change
              suggested to install http-server npm - which I already have -- installed again.
    (c) app.js files retained by history
          finally by getting it worked by deleting history
    (d) require is undefined (while importing jquery)
          reason - require is executable on node.js, not readable by browser (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45723592/8359363)
        what to do?????????
          bundler needed - (requirejs, browserify, webpack,..)

        searcherd for alternative
          babel - compiler (modern JS to core JS) Hiyaaa, I have it

        How to use Babel on browser????? (http://discuss.babeljs.io/t/using-babel-in-the-browser-without-a-bundler/100/1)
          can use jspm.io  (http://discuss.babeljs.io/t/using-babel-in-the-browser-without-a-bundler/100/3)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Great!!! both tests and browser are running (27.10.2017) - <<<(https://github.com/go2rob/microPro/commit/4e5bf0d2392c14b9d363bccc7d08b065389f8db1)>>>
